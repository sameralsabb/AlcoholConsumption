                                <p>The objective of our project was to examine alcohol consumption in most of the countries
                                    in the world in relation to various factors like Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Mortality
                                    Rate, and other factors.<br /></p>
                                </div>
                            <h3>Process</h3>
                            <div class "col-md-12">
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Gathering our datasets, of which we pulled data from Wikipedia (for alcohol consumption
                                        in countries across the world and the popularity of types of alcohol in each country.
                                        Also gathered data (placeholder text)</li>
                                    <li>Also found a resource online that provided the vector data needed to draw borders
                                        for our choropleth map that we then translated from json into geojson.</li>
                                    <li>After gathering our data, we cleaed it in Excel and Pandas, made it into a dataframe,
                                        then created a SQLite database from our data which we connected via Flask.</li>
                                    <li>After getting our data connected to our front-end, we created a visualization using
                                        Leaflet.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Then created a choropleth map shading the various countries based on the type of
                                        alcohol (beer, wine, or spirits).</li>
                                    <li>Also created visualizations showcasing the potential relationship between GDP and
                                        Total Alcohol Consumption and another visualization.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                            <h3>Complications</h3>
                            <div class "col-md-12">
                                <ul>
                                    <li>First issue we ran into was the SQLite database not having the correct primary key
                                        as well as being in the wrong data type, i.e. switching from TEXT to FLOAT and vice
                                        versa.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Then ran into an issue with connecting our SQLite database to our Flask app.</li>
                                    <li>Ran into issues getting our Leaflet map to work correctly.</li>
                                    <li>Minor issue getting our HTML pages linked correctly via Flask, but that was a easy
                                        fix by referencing the correct route.</li>
                                    <li>Most complicated issue that we had a ton of help from our honorary 5th member (Julien!)
                                        was combining the vectormap.geojson that had our border data and our SQLite data.
                                        SQLite data contained the favorite types of alcohol by percent that NEEDED to be
                                        in the .geojson so that we could reference it in the choropleth call.</li>
                                    <li>Issue creating a filter button for our choropleth that would filter between the different
                                        types of favorite alcohol in countries.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <div class "col-md-12">
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Our choropleth map hopefully looks cool and beer overall seems to be the alcoholic beverage of choice in most countries.</li>
                                    <li>There doesn't seem to be a relationship between GDP and Total Alcohol Consumption according to our scatter plot.</li>
                                    <li>(Placeholder Text).</li>

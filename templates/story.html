                                        Product (GDP), Mortality Rate, and other factors.</p>

                                            <li>Gathering our datasets, of which we pulled data from Wikipedia (for alcohol
                                                consumption in countries across the world and the popularity of types of
                                                alcohol in each country.</li>
                                            <li>Also found a resource online that provided the vector data needed to draw
                                                borders for our choropleth map that we then translated from json into geojson.</li>
                                            <li>After gathering our data, we cleaed it in Excel and Pandas, made it into
                                                a dataframe, then created a SQLite database from our data which we connected
                                                via Flask.</li>
                                            <li>After getting our data connected to our front-end, we created a visualization
                                                using Leaflet.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Then created a choropleth map shading the various countries based on the
                                                type of alcohol (beer, wine, or spirits).</li>
                                            <li>Also created visualizations showcasing the potential relationship between
                                                GDP and Total Alcohol Consumption and another visualization.</li>

                                            <li>First issue we ran into was the SQLite database not having the correct primary
                                                key as well as being in the wrong data type, i.e. switching from TEXT to
                                                FLOAT and vice versa.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Then ran into an issue with connecting our SQLite database to our Flask app.</li>
                                            <li>Ran into issues getting our Leaflet map to work correctly.</li>
                                            <li>Minor issue getting our HTML pages linked correctly via Flask, but that was
                                                a easy fix by referencing the correct route.</li>
                                            <li>Most complicated issue that we had a ton of help from our honorary 5th member
                                                (Julien!) was combining the vectormap.geojson that had our border data and
                                                our SQLite data. SQLite data contained the favorite types of alcohol by percent
                                                that NEEDED to be in the .geojson so that we could reference it in the choropleth
                                                call.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Issue creating a filter button for our choropleth that would filter between
                                                the different types of favorite alcohol in countries.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                                alcoholic beverage of choice in most countries.</li>
                                            <li>There doesn't seem to be a relationship between GDP and Total Alcohol Consumption
                                                according to our scatter plot.</li>
